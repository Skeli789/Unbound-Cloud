New Features:
-GTS (and make sure bad words are replaced if necessary)
-Symbol tutorial when a new cloud file is created

Bug Fixes:
-Can wonder trade with self? (Did it on the website - saved for a friend trade and then traded while a mon was up for Wonder Trade and it happened when putting another mon up after the original was no longer in a wonder trade for some reason)
-Make sure placing Pokemon in clears the "capped" flag
