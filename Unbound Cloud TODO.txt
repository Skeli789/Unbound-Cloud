New Features:
-GTS (and make sure bad words are replaced if necessary)
--The times a species has been traded should be recorded
-Redesign title screen

Bug Fixes:
-Can wonder trade with self? (Did it on the website - saved for a friend trade and then traded while a mon was up for Wonder Trade and it happened when putting another mon up after the original was no longer in a wonder trade for some reason)
-Progression locked save files should say advance further (eg. Sandbox Nuzlocke wiped Gym 6) and give specific reason of advancement
