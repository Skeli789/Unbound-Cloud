New Features:
-GTS (and make sure bad words are replaced if necessary)
--The times a species has been traded should be recorded
-Redesign title screen
-Add password reset screen
-A code is sent each time cloud boxes are sent that has to be sent back when they're saved (not account code). This code changes each time and prevents issues with opening mupltiple tabs (also should be needed to wonder trade)

Bug Fixes:
-Can wonder trade with self? (Did it on the website - saved for a friend trade and then traded while a mon was up for Wonder Trade and it happened when putting another mon up after the original was no longer in a wonder trade for some reason)
-Progression locked save files should say advance further (eg. Sandbox Nuzlocke wiped Gym 6) and give specific reason of advancement
